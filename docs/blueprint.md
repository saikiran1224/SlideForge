## Core Features:

- Presentation Outline Generation: Accept natural language input describing a presentation's topic and objectives, generating a basic presentation outline as a starting point.
- Document Context Integration: Parse uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) to extract key points and context for enriching slide content, using an LLM to tool integration of this data into the generated slides.
- Slide Generation: Generates individual PPT slides that present extracted and interpreted key points, potentially using visualizations, graphics, and charts.
- Input UI: Provides a UI to input the title of the presentation and a textarea to enter in a natural language prompt. Provides an upload area for PPT context documents.
- Presentation Preview: Presents generated slides in a navigable, full-screen presentation preview mode, mimicking the experience of a live presentation.
- Export presentation: SlideForge can be exported as PPTX file

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#29ABE2) evoking trust, innovation, and professionalism, essential for product management presentations.
- Background color: Light, desaturated blue (#E5F6FD) to ensure readability and reduce visual fatigue during presentations.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#F2994A), which provides a contrasting call to action.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', sans-serif, which complements the business theme.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, which ensures body is legible for the likely lengthy product decks.
- Use a set of professional and modern icons to represent different aspects of the presentation (e.g., goals, strategy, metrics).
- Emphasize a clean, modern layout with clear sections and a logical flow.
